Building and Connecting an Amazon RDS Database with an EC2 Web Application

🎯 Objective

To create and configure a cloud-based MySQL database using Amazon RDS, and connect it to a web application hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

🧰 Tools and AWS Services Used

Amazon EC2 – Hosts the web application

Amazon RDS (MySQL) – Cloud database service

Amazon VPC – Provides network isolation

Subnets & DB Subnet Groups – For multi-AZ deployment

Security Groups – Control inbound/outbound access

IAM – Manages permissions and roles

⚙️ Step-by-Step Procedure

Task 1: Create a VPC and Security Groups

1. Created a VPC (Lab VPC) with private and public subnets.

2. Configured Security Groups:

WebServer Security Group – allows HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22).

DB Security Group – allows MySQL (port 3306) access from the web server.

Task 2: Create a DB Subnet Group

1. Opened the RDS console → Subnet groups → Create DB Subnet Group.

2. Name: DB-Subnet-Group
Description: DB Subnet Group
3. Selected Lab VPC.
4. Added two private subnets from different Availability Zones:
10.0.1.0/24 (Private Subnet 1)
10.0.3.0/24 (Private Subnet 2)
5. Clicked Create to complete the subnet group setup.

Task 3: Create an Amazon RDS DB Instance

1. Opened RDS → Databases → Create Database.
2. Chose:
Standard create
Engine type: MySQL
Version: Latest available
Template: Dev/Test

3. DB Instance Identifier: lab-db

Master username: main

Password: lab-password

4. Instance class: db.t3.medium (Burstable)
5. Storage type: General Purpose (SSD)
6. VPC: Lab VPC
7. Selected DB Security Group under existing VPC security groups.
8. Disabled Enhanced Monitoring and Automated Backups for faster deployment.
9. Initial Database Name: lab
10. Clicked Create Database and waited until status became Available.
Task 4: Interact with the Database via Web Application

1. Copied the RDS Endpoint from the RDS console.
Example:
lab-db.cggqlhnxvnw.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com
2. Opened the Web Application using the EC2 Public IP.
3. Clicked on the RDS link at the top of the page.
4. Entered:
Endpoint: (copied from RDS)
Database name: lab
Username: main
Password: lab-password
5. Clicked Submit.
The app connected to the RDS MySQL database successfully.
6. Tested by adding, editing, and deleting contacts in the Address Book.
Data was stored and replicated across Availability Zones.

📊 Result

The web application successfully connected to the RDS MySQL database hosted in AWS.
All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) worked properly, and the data was automatically replicated to the standby instance in a second Availability Zone for high availability.
